# JXMath
Doing math in C#

Platform: .Net 8

My current personal project, started in 2024.

Due to work and other life commitments, not much time can be spent on this. I hope to update the repo every half a year when there's a major holiday.

Components:

* **JXMath** - math library
* **JXMathWPF** - visualization library

Current status as of 2024-12-31

First commit
* JXMath - has an implementation of the EM algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models
* JXMathWPF - has a histogram viewer and a partially completed xy plot viewer
